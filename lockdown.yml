  Thanks for your Pull Request! :smile:  This repo on GitHub is just a mirror of our real git repositories though, and can't really handle PRs. :frown: Hopefully you can redo the PR, and direct it to the git.postgresql.org repos?  We have a developer guide, if that helps: https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/So,_you_want_to_be_a_developer%3F
